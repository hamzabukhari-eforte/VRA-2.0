        &quot;The VRA Cricket Stadium in Amstelveen, which is south of the city,
        is known to get a lot of rain and overcast skies, which can make it
        hard to bat. The stadium was built in 1970, but in 2012 it was
        rethinking itself. The atmosphere was one of excitement with cricket
        was nothing short. The stadium was one of the best in the world.&quot;
